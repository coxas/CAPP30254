Progress Report:

HW1 consisted of three parts. I received 20/20 on part 1, so I didn't make any clear changes. 

I redid the entirety of part 2. hw1_part2.py contains straight python code for part 2, and hw1_part2_REDO.ipynb contains that same code along with some extra analysis using Jupyter to show results and also that my functions work properly. 

I don't think my understanding of the statistics in part 3 was correct either, so I rewrote my answers using the original feedback that 
I obtained.
