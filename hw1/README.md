Progress Report:

HW1 consisted of three parts. I received 20/20 on part 1, so I didn't make any clear changes. I redid the entirety of part 2. 
I don't think my understanding of the statistics in part 3 was correct either, so I rewrote my answers using the original feedback that 
I obtained. I also got 2 points off for failing to include axis labels in the graphs in my evidence, so I fixed that as well.
